## 👋 Hi, I'm Bloo Nguyen  
**Principal Engineer | Builder of Platforms | Founder of Brewd**

I’m a software engineer with 8+ years of experience architecting and building reliable systems across data platforms, IoT, and cloud-native environments.  
I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, maintainable systems — from real-time data pipelines to user-facing platforms that make an impact.
